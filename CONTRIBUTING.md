## Conventions

### Formatting

All committed code must be properly formatted. See the `/ide/` directory for formatting settings
for specific IDEs. If no settings exist for your chosen IDE, please create an issue to add them.

### Branching

[GitFlow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) is used for managing 
development. Branches must be named depending on the type of branch, as follows:

- New feature branches: `feature/${issueId}-${Issue_title}`, e.g. `feature/3-Example_issue`
- Bug fix branches: `bugfix/${issueId}-${Issue_title}`, e.g. `bugfix/4-Example_bug`
- Release branches: `release/${version}`, e.g. `release/1.0.0`
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/${version}`, e.g. `hotfix/1.0.1`

### Commit messages

The subject of all commit messages must be in the format `#${issueId} Description of change`, for
example: `#3 Fix some bug`. Messages may or may not include a detailed description, as required. 
[See here](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for more guidelines on writing good commit 
messages.
